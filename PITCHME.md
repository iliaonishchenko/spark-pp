### Spark introduction

### Hadoop/MapReduce

Hadoop is widely used large-scale batch data processing framework  
It was great because of:
* simple API
* fault tolerance
---
@snap[north]
#### and it was like
@snaped
![WaitingForSpark](images/endless-waiting.png)&size=90% auto
---
### and now Spark is here
@ul
* fault tolerant
* functional style api
* different strategy for handling latency 
@ulend
--- 
Data is immutable and stored in-memory     
Operations are functional transformations       
Fault tolerance is achieved by replaying transformations starting from original dataset     
  
As result Spark can be 100x (watch the numbers) faster then Hadoop

### iterations in Hadoop/MapReduce vs Spark

### some cool things about Spark: 
@ul
* native Scala, Java, Python, R interface   
* interactive shell (repl)    
* efficient distributed operations   
* reusing existing Hadoop ecosystem  
* opensource 
@ulend

@snap[north]
##### Spark distributed mode
@snaped
---
@ul
* Master-slave architecture   
* Driver is the process where the main method runs  
* Executors are responsible for running the individual tasks in given Spark job
* Driver + executor == spark app 
@ulend

### There are 3 collection types:
@snap[west]
* RDD
* DataFrame
* Dataset 
@snaped

@snap[west]
and they are
@ul
* resilient
* distributed
* immutable
* in-memory
* lazy
* parallel-partitioned 
@ulend

### Resilient Distributed Dataset 
@snap[east]
![RDD Flow](images/rdd-flow.png)&size=80%
@snapped
@snap[wesr]
Seems like immutable sequential or parallel Scala collection.

### RDD operations
There are two main types:
* transformations
returns new collection as a result
```scala
map([B]f: A => B): RDD[B]
```
* actions
```scala
reduce(op: (A, A) => A): A
```
---
### world count 
```scala
val text = spark.textFile("hdfs://path/to/file.txt")
val count = rdd.flatMap(line => line.split(" "))
                    .map(word => (word, 1))
                    .reduceByKey(_ + _)
```
